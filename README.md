Dual-Clock FIFO Design  
Designed a dual-clock FIFO to support data transfer across asynchronous domains, using circular buffer logic with Gray-encoded pointers in Verilog.  
Addressed CDC challenges with two-stage synchronizers and validated pointer crossing safety using Questa CDC.  
Verified design functionality and transfer correctness using QuestaSim waveform analysis.
